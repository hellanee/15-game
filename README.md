# 15-game
This is a game where you have a field 4x4 and there are 15 cells with numbers and one empty cell. When you start, you generate a field where those cells are mixed, then, by clicking on the sells that are close to the sides of the empty cell, you move those tiles and try to place them in the right order from 1 to 15. The generator is made so you always get the solvable puzzle.

## Requirements
Visual studio with C++ and winforms installed
